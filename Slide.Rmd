## Wordcloud with my interests

I made a shiny app that generates a word cloud out of three different books I chose from [Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org). I chose Romeo and Juliet, Artists' Wives and Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France.

## Overview

This was the final project on the  [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products) course which I am taking as my last course on the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

Source code for ui.R, server.R and global.R files are available on my GitHub repo:
[https://github.com/guffakristins/Data-products-final](https://github.com/guffakristins/Data-products-final)

The first part of the assignment was to develop a shiny app and host it on the shiny app site:
[https://guffaakristins.shinyapps.io/Word_cloud/](https://guffaakristins.shinyapps.io/Word_cloud/)

## App functionality

The app itself makes a word cloud for three different books I picked out. 

You choose a book in a drop down menu and press change when you want it to load. You choose the minimum frequency of the word in the book and the maximum number of words on the word cloud image. Both later options are on a slider. The words will appear in different colors and sizes depending on frequency of the word in the book.

The code reads the books through .txt files I picked out and pictures the words that fall into the the above category.

## The data

The books are:
[Romeo and Juliet](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1112/pg1112.txt) by William Shakespeare.

It's classic with beautiful words.

[Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/22718/pg22718.txt), Volume 1, by Elise Whitlock Rose

I love architecture and cathedrals and cloisters are often described really beautifully and I could imaging the word cloud woud be beautiful

[Artists' Wives](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/22522/pg22522.txt) by Alphonse Daudet

I was honestly interested to see what came out :) 


## My app

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
library(memoise)

               "Artists' Wives" = "wives",
               "Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of
France" = "cathedrals")

# Using "memoise" to automatically cache the results
getTermMatrix <- memoise(function(book) {
        # Careful not to let just any name slip in here; a
        # malicious user could manipulate this value.
        if (!(book %in% books))
                stop("Unknown book")
        
        text <- readLines(sprintf("./%s.txt", book),
                          encoding="UTF-8")
        
        myCorpus = Corpus(VectorSource(text))
        myCorpus = tm_map(myCorpus, content_transformer(tolower))
        myCorpus = tm_map(myCorpus, removePunctuation)
        myCorpus = tm_map(myCorpus, removeNumbers)
        myCorpus = tm_map(myCorpus, removeWords,
                          c(stopwords("SMART"), "thy","gutenbergtm","gutenberg", "thou", "thee", "the", "and", "but"))
        
        myDTM = TermDocumentMatrix(myCorpus,
                                   control = list(minWordLength = 1))
        
        m = as.matrix(myDTM)
        
        sort(rowSums(m), decreasing = TRUE)
